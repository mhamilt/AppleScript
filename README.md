# Applescripts
A wee collection of useful applescripts I've collected over time.


## IPviaEmail
This script sends the WAN IP address of your machine to a specified email address.
If, like me, you have a MacMini sitting at home as a server, this script can be
connected to a mac Mail rule for easy update of IP address. 

This is mainly for those who are too lazy to organise a static IP but would
like remote access of their machine

## IPviaText
Same as IPviaEmail but will send an iMessage instead. Only useful if you have
an iPhone. This script exhibits a slightly different way of parsing the WAN IP
from checkip.dyndns.org
